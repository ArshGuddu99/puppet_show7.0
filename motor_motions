]required motion in horizontal direction = 37 cm
in 1 complete rotation, belt length of 2*2*pi*0.5 cm=6.28 cm is set free
hence to move by 37 cm, the motor needs to rotate 37/6.28=5.89 times complete times 
Hence angle required to rotate= 5.89* 2*pi= 2120.4 degrees
Each step of the stepper motor, by some miracle, is 0.9 degrees
Hence, to rotate 4240.8 degrees, the number of steps required is 2356
Hence, approximately, 2400 steps

Approximate time to be spent in traversing horizontally = 10 seconds
t=sqrt(2*s/a) => a=2*s/t^2 Hence, approximate acceleration= 50 steps/(sec^2)
Maximum speed u=Sqrt(2*s*a)= 489 steps/sec
Hence, appproximate value =500 steps/sec;

move value = 2400
Max_speed =500
accel = 50
